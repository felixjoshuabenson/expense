# Expense Tracker App

An intuitive and responsive Flutter app designed to help users track and categorize their expenses. This app provides users with a comprehensive view of their spending through an interactive chart and an easy-to-use expense entry system.

## Features

- Expense Categories: Users can categorize their expenses into predefined categories such as Food, Travel, Leisure, Work, and Charity.
- Interactive Chart: The app provides a responsive bar chart visualization of expenses in each category.
- Expense List: Users can see a list of all expenses, with the ability to delete an expense and undo the deletion.
- Add New Expense: Add new expenses with a title, amount, date, and category.
- Firebase Integration: User expenses are now stored in Firebase, ensuring that data is not lost when the app is closed or restarted.
- Responsive UI: The app layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Known Issues

- Delete Issue: Currently, when an expense is deleted, it reappears after the app restarts. This seems to be related to how the app is synchronizing the firebaseId and managing deletion in Firebase. Contributions to address this issue are welcome!
